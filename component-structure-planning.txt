we have
* sound design (multiple synths expose same api)
  * could share amp envelope?
* score generation (multiple types of scores share same api)
* score display (doesn't have to be same data type for all scores...)
* posenet models and tensorflow pose detection

* ability to change between levels


* global state--
  * which level we're on
  * the current score

how many of these things are components? many will be library modules
